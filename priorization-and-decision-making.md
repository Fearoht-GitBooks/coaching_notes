## Product Priorization

By approaching the product decision from the angle of highest impact, you can surface several key factors:

* Is this feature ultra-important, or more of a nice-to-have?
* If we build this feature, will it compromise our core product for_other_customers?
  * → esto pensarlo también en product-market fit. _Ej. hoy encontramos que nos quieren porque somos rápidos, simples y nuestro onboarding es sencillo. Si agregamos features, complejidad, podemos perder eso como un advantage, y con eso nuestro product-market fit._
* Is this product request really the full story, or just a symptom of a deeper, more fundamental need?
* And finally—is this the most important place to be spending our time and effort right now?

## Feasibility-Desirability-Viability

**Feasibility**is a technical consideration and will need the inputs of the technical team members. This would include back-end engineers, UI designers and front-end developers. It might also include technical partners that are providing services or support to the tech stack. Product leaders are not looking for personal opinions here, rather just what is technically possible versus impossible or highly improbable.

**Desirability**is the customer-experience focused part of the analysis. This takes into consideration the needs of the end user, the interaction elements, affordances and how these are to be marketed or sold. This information can be gathered from the researchers, UX designers, marketing and strategists. In turn this information would have been derived from user tests, prototype validation and analytics.

Finally, the**viability**of the work needs to be considered as a function of the overall business. This insight is provided by the product manager’s and relevant executives. Viability also includes factors related to the industry, regulatory environment, and financial oversight, or legal considerations.

## Think beyond MVP and v1

Creating a minimum viable product, and then a version 1 is one thing, but there’s also everything that happens post-launch: operations, maintenance, feature requests from users, continuous improvements, and new versions of other products and/or platforms that are

integrated.

A quick think on what the challenges and obstacles might be after a launch will bring these to light without much effort, and engineers will be thankful that you didn’t ignore these realities. Rough estimates suggest that the initial effort of building a new feature is often only a third to one half of the total effort spent on it over its entire lifetime. In other words: the aftermath is more costly then the initial build, and some “quick small things” become very costly in the long run.
