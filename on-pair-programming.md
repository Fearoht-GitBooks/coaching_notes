#### Pair Rotations

Rotating pairs means that after working together for some time, one half of the pair leaves the story, while the other person onboards somebody new to continue. The person who stays is often called the “anchor” of a story.

One category of reasons why to rotate is logistics. Your pairing partner could be sick or going on holiday. Or one of you is working remotely for a day, and the work requires physical presence on site, e.g. because there is a hardware setup involved.

Another group of reasons why to rotate is to mix things up. Either the two of you have been working together for a while and are starting to show signs of “cabin fever” because you are spending too much time together. Or you’re working on something very tedious and energy-draining - a rotation will give one of you a break, and a new person can bring in some fresh perspectives and energy.

Finally, the most given reason for pair rotations is to avoid knowledge silos, increase collective code ownership, and get some more code review on-the-go. Pairing itself is already helping with those things, but rotations can further increase the average number of eyes on each line of code that goes to production.

As to the ideal frequency of rotations, this is where opinions diverge. Some people believe that rotations every 2-3 days are crucial to ensure a sufficient knowledge spread and quality. Every rotation comes with some costs though. There’s the time to onboard a new person, and the cost of a context switch for one of the two. If there is no constant anchor for continuity, the risk increases that tacit knowledge about the problem and solution space gets lost and triggers rework. For more junior developers it’s sometimes more beneficial to stay on something for longer, so they have sufficient time to immerse themselves in a topic and give new knowledge time to settle.

Think about the trade off between these costs and the benefits. For example, let's say you have high quality knowledge sharing already, with team "show and tells", readable code and good documentation. In that case, maybe an insistence on frequent rotations only marginally improves your collective code ownership, while creating high amounts of friction and overhead.

### But really, why bother?

We talked a lot about the benefits of pair programming, but even more about its challenges. Pairing requires a lot of different skills to get it right, and might even influence other processes in the team. So why bother? Is it really worth the hassle?

For a team to be comfortable with and successful at pair programming, they will have to work on all the skills helpful to overcome its challenges: Concentration and focus, task organisation, time management, communication, giving and receiving feedback, empathy, vulnerability - and these are actually all skills that help immensely to become a well-functioning, collaborative and effective team. Pairing gives everybody on the team a chance to work on these skills together.

Another factor that is widely talked about today as a success factor for effective teams is diversity. Diversity of perspectives, genders, backgrounds and skills has proven to improve a team's performance - but it often increases friction first. It can even increase some of the challenges with pair programming we talked about. For example, one of the key ingredients we suggested is showing vulnerability, which is especially hard for team members of underrepresented groups.

Consider this headline from Harvard Business Review: ["Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable - and That's Why They Perform Better"](https://hbr.org/2016/09/diverse-teams-feel-less-comfortable-and-thats-why-they-perform-better) . The authors are making the point that "Homogeneous teams feel easier - but easy is bad for performance. (...) this idea goes against many people's intuitions". To explain, they point out a cognitive bias called the fluency heuristic: "We prefer information that is more easily processed, and judge it to be more true, or more beautiful."

This bias makes us strive for simplicity, which serves us very well in a lot of situations in software development. But we don't think it serves us well in the case of pair programming. Pairing feels hard – but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not good for a team. And most importantly, it does not have to stay hard. In [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S92vVAEofes) , Pia Nilsson describes measures her team at Spotify took to get over the uncomfortable friction initially caused by introducing practices like pair programming. Among other things, she mentions feedback culture, non-violent communication, [psychological safety](https://hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it) , humility, and having a sense of purpose.

Pair programming, extreme programming, and agile software development as a whole are all about embracing change. Agile software practitioners acknowledge that change is inevitable, so they want to be prepared for it.

We suggest that another thing we should embrace and prepare for is friction, because it's also inevitable on the way to becoming a highly effective, diverse team. By embracing friction we do NOT mean to say, "let's just have lots of conflicts and we'll get better". What we mean is that teams should equip themselves with the tools necessary to deal with friction, and have them in their toolbox by default, not just when the team is already having problems. Practice feedback, improve team communication, take measures to create a psychologically safe environment.

We believe that pair programming is often avoided because it can create friction, but we would ask you to give it a chance. If you consciously treat it as an improvable skill, and work on getting better at it, you will end up with a more resilient team.
