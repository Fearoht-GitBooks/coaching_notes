If the only life you're focused on improving is your own, then you're missing what it takes to be an 'elite' leader.

Truly effective, elite leaders don't just motivate, they influence others and 'inspire to aspire'. They create new leaders, not just more followers and to do so a leader must have integrity as his or her most important trait and intellectual humility as her or his foundational mindset. They must also have empathy, passion and purpose if they expect to have influence.

Leadership is, always has been and always will be about influence, not authority. With that in mind, it is important to remember that for the most part, people are most influenced by those that make them feel important.

People feel important when they are treated with compassion and trustworthiness since trustworthy people are always seen as competent. The 'elite', influential leader's impact and influence must be felt as a result of their presence, but makes a more important impact in their absence. The keys to positive influencing of others is to show competence, credibility, empathy, integrity, confidence and consistency. Unlike dark influence which is usually the result of narcissism, psychopathy and a Machiavellian mindset.

From managing conflict, to discouraging disingenuous compliance (which is the greatest threat to an organization's growth); to gaining a genuine commitment from those he/she leads (the optimum goal of a true leader) the effective leader will always risk vitriol and unpopularity telling others what they need to hear, rather than trying to attain popularity and new followers telling them what they want to hear. That would scream lack of integrity, and become the breeding ground for a toxic environment.

The elite and effective leader has little problem saying NO! Typically, great leaders and the ultra successful say NO, more often than they say YES.

The elite leader will always try to make the right decision rather than make a decision, right. An elite leader is unselfish, understands the dark side of influence and realizes the task at hand is to 'inspire to aspire' and empower others. The goal for the elite leader is not accolades and applause, it is to foster the sustainable growth and development of an organization by creating new leaders.

A good leader, is a good teacher and makes him or herself progressively unnecessary to be around for the organization to prosper. Which probably explains why that in study after study, it is proven those that focused influence on a job had lower success scores (and incomes) than those who focused on pleasing their supervisors.

Also, great leaders, use hope, not fear to gain support. They know that optimists are more apt to find solutions as opposed to a pessimist that seem to always find a problem for every solution.

Bad leaders are usually filled with too many opinions and resort to insults when their leadership is challenged and their positions start to crumble. I have a very simple rule of thumb when it comes to witnessing insults and opinions; disregard them all!

Opinions are not fact and merely a reflection of a personal agenda and usually nothing more than a confession of one's character. It’s a waste of time to try to change one's character, which is why trying to change one's opinions are a waste of time.

**Leadership and integrity**: "_In order to be a leader, a man must have followers. and to have followers, a man must have their confidence. The supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity. Without it, no real success is possible, no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office. If a mans associates find him guilty of being a phony, if they find that he lacks forthright integrity, he will fail. His teachings and actions must "square" with each other. Therefore the first great need is integrity and high purpose." Dwight Eisenhower_

\*\*Leaders born or made? -\*\*This is quite a popular subject on social media these days. I believe that it’s a combination of both. I think that you need to be born with certain traits (integrity, compassion, empathy, confidence, curiosity, courage, etc.) to be a successful leader. Even that however will not be enough to be an elite leader.

Acquiring emotional intelligence to go along with artful social intelligence skills is a very important aspect of becoming an effective and respected leader.

**"All forms of acquiring elite success require a long term, committed obedience to stay on the endless road of inner and external understanding and constant self-improvement. This road is paved with many stones, but the foundational boulders are without question, Integrity and Intellectual Humility.**

Adopting a mindset of living within the foundations of "intellectual humility" will help leaders effectively develop followers to commit to yield positive and sustainable results. Intellectual Humility" challenges you to lead by example and not try to be better than others, rather it commits you only to be a better version of yourself as you master emotional intelligence and become socially skilled.

Attaining a mindset of intellectual humility will also help remedy the current communication crisis which is becoming more and more prevalent with each passing day. Whether it be technology advances or the current disease of discourse, our state of personal communication (or lack thereof) from our leaders is troubling and toxic.

Diminished skills of articulation and cordial conversation is as alarming as it is crippling to the growth and development of individuals and organizations. Where have all the storytellers gone!

Communication these days is overly calculated and more apt to deliver disingenuous perfection rather than genuine imperfection. The former is too contrived and meant to be in-arguable, like words cast in stone, whereas the latter is more passionate and open to objective and mutually beneficial conversation.

**With all thy getting, get intellectual humility!**

Intellectual humility is a mindset that improves emotional and social intelligence, both required traits to succeed as an entrepreneur and business leader. It's being intelligent enough to understand the importance of knowing what you don't know is just as important as knowing what you do know; being understated in a way that your reach never extends beyond your grasp; possessing a mind so open and curious, that you genuinely strive to learn something every day, from every one that you encounter; being passionately interested in others, knowing that doing so makes you more interesting to everyone.

* My thoughts on intellectual humility and effective leadership in order to create an empowering, sustainable culture in the workplace was recently featured in The University of South Florida's Faculty Assistance Newsletter. You can find it here: [http://www.woodassociates.net/FAP/Newsletters/Search/PDF/FAP%20November%202018%2011\_19\_18.pdf](http://www.woodassociates.net/FAP/Newsletters/Search/PDF/FAP%20November%202018%2011\_19\_18.pdf)

**Here are my 15 tenets to consider now, to develop your Intellectual Humility**

* Know that underachievers will always find an excuse; Winners will always make time.
* Learn when to give in, but don’t EVER give up, especially on something you believe in, but NEVER, fall in love with your inventory just because it’s your inventory.
* Know that lapses in judgment are truly human, but there is no such thing as a lapse of integrity.
* Remember intelligent people fight fire with water, never with fire. Emotional intelligence is an art.
* Be as passionate about understanding others as your desire to be understood by others.
* Know to be INTERESTING, you must first be INTERESTED. Be a good listener and then an articulate and genuinely passionate storyteller.
* Remember that time kills all deals. Be as purposeful and expeditious about finishing a mission as you were about starting one.
* Always possess a child's curiosity to go along with awe-inspiring humbleness. Genuine imperfection is ALWAYS more attractive than disingenuous perfection. ALWAYS BE REAL
* Know that knowing what you don’t know is often more important than what you do know. Learn something EVERYDAY, from EVERYONE you meet.
* Have high expectations of others, but even higher ones of yourself. Be a great teammate.
* Compromise to cooperate, but never at the expense of your own integrity. Always try to make the right decision and if you don't, don't try to make the decision right.
* Be understated with a grasp that extends well beyond your reach. The world already has far too many overstated people with a reach that extends beyond their grasp.
* Always be eternally optimistic and genuinely excited about the success of others.
* Demand quality from partners by always choosing “character” over “characters”. Become the example of the integrity you demand in others.
* Express genuine kindness, benevolence, compassion and gratitude. Let your kindness be your strength, not your weakness. Always be seen as a giver, never a taker.
* The above 15 "commandments" is from my award winning book “THE ENTREPRENEURS EDGE - Tapping Into Your Inner Entrepreneur” [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1478794003](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1478794003)

In truth, Intellectual Humility isn't really very complicated at all. Basically its justan anatomy and path to achieving what many refer to as "the golden rule." I often say, if you want to make a real difference to those who surround you, just react in the same way as if your parents and grandparents were watching!

The 15 tenets I am asking you to consider could be the new foundation to launch your journey to find success. In the class room, the schoolyard, the team locker room, the family room and the board room you'll find that intellectual humility, character and integrity are important ingredients to a better, more productive life.

In this way,_ _your hands will always be extended in friendship and never in want. And, should you find yourself more fortunate than others, build a longer table, not a taller fence. The grass may not always be greener on the other side, but will always be greener where you water it!"_
