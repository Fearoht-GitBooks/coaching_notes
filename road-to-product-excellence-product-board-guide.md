**Product excellence**is the name of an approach to product management that emphasizes_getting the right products to market faster_through_deep user insight_, a_clear product strategy_, and coherent_roadmap_. Its name derives from the end goal shared by product managers who strive to make products that matter – products that make a difference in the work, and lives, of users.

Unlike product management of the past that emphasized optimizing the delivery of software through Agile methodologies, product excellence places special emphasis on building the_right features_in the\*right way.\*It aims to deliver features that directly target user needs, and do so in less time. That means less effort is wasted working on features users don’t really need, and users get more value in less time. You’ll know you’re on the right track when users are downright delighted by your product – what it can do for them, and how it makes them feel along the way.

Nosotros hemos mejorado en building faster than before, and building the right way. En lo que no hemos mejorado ha sido building the right features. ¿Por qué?

## The three pillars of product excellence

Through conversations with thousands of product managers, we’ve discovered the ones who are most successful share three areas of mastery:

* **Deep user insight**
* **Clear product strategy**
* **Coherent roadmap**

## Deep User Insight

_The entire product team has a deep understanding of what users really need._

The best product teams develop systems for funneling a steady stream of user feedback back to the product team. Whether generated from sales calls, support tickets, or formal user research, they store these insights in a central repository, accessible to all.

Product managers, designers, or dedicated researchers interview users about their needs before feature prioritization even takes place. Solution ideas are prototyped and tested along the way, to validate feature ideas while minimizing the risk of wasted effort. Feature usage is monitored after launch, and qualitative insights are collected to inform future enhancements.

In the top organizations, colleagues from across the organization are equipped with a better understanding of user needs, helping them excel in their work – whether that’s prioritizing, designing, developing, promoting, supporting, or selling.

## Clear Product Strategy

_The entire organization is aligned around key strategic objectives._

With so many competing priorities and different stakeholders to please, it’s easy to get stuck in a reactive mindset – putting out one fire and then the next, impulsively adopting the hottest tech trends, or going tit for tat with competitors.

That’s why the most effective product organizations prioritize around clear business objectives. Rather than haphazardly swinging from one feature to the next, they tend to work on initiatives that unify the entire team’s efforts around achieving some measurable objective, before moving on to another.

These objectives may relate to solving the needs of specific types of users or market segments. Or, they may relate to driving growth, competitive differentiation, regulatory compliance, security or any number of other goals that would help the business succeed in the mid-to-long-term. In the latter case, they may even directly support organization-wide OKRs, or priorities set by leadership that direct every team’s efforts.

Whether the goal is to drive user acquisition or improve platform reliability, everyone working on the product knows why their work is important – why it matters.

## Coherent Product Roadmap

_Everyone across the organization is invested in a common vision for the product._

True product leaders ensure that, in their companies, product management is not a black box. They know that everyone across the organization works to support the product, and they’re all invested in its success. They cherish the responsibility not just to share the plan, but rally everyone around a common vision for where the product is headed, and why.

For them, product roadmaps are not static documents of what features will be delivered when. They’re dynamic visualizations (closely linked to their product plans) that help communicate the outcomes the product team is working towards, and how they support the organization’s overarching goals.

If some roadmap decisions are hard for certain stakeholders to swallow (after all, their jobs may be on the line!) they understand the rationale behind tough trade-offs product managers had to make. The business context and user insights behind each decision are always on hand, so everyone can buy in on a decision, even if they don’t personally agree with it.

Gran parte del esfuerzo que tenemos que hacer en **deep user insight**. La falta de eso es lo que nos da una táctica de producto - el roadmap - nublado y hace que el camino a la visión esté poco claro.
