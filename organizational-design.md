## Intentional Organizational Design

[Designing the Intentional Organization - The Ready - Medium](https://medium.com/the-ready/designing-the-intentional-organization-6abc29b9b4a2)

Instead, it has a specific practice around noticing, making sense, and experimenting that allows it to change itself over time.

1. How do we become more aware to what’s happening around and within us?
2. How do we make sense of what’s happening around and within us?
3. How can we make it simpler and easier to change ourselves based on this information?

First, get good at**Noticing. Then, get good at Making Sense of What You’ve Noticed. Finally, get Comfortable Trying New Things (and Repeat).**

## No Excuses / Accountability:

* No rechacemos el error, pero tampoco estemos justificando por qué no estamos llegando a nuestros objetivos.
* Decir qué pasó, pero no para justificar, como excusa, si no para aprender, debrief y lección aprendida.

## Don’t use elusive values, focus on specific ideas that are memorable, actionable and frequently invoked to guide day-to-day activities.

After several rounds of fine-tuning, the culture committee members identified the norms, values, and behaviors they wanted to encourage:

* **I’ve got this.**
* (**Tell it like it is)**
* **Show the love.**
* **Do what scares you.**
* (**Open up and listen.)**
* **Only accept awesome.**

## Principles of Organizational Design

[What is Organizational Design?](https://nobl.io/leadership-resources/organizational-design)

1. [Serve.An](http://serve.an) organization’s highest priority is to serve its customers and communities.
2. Anticipate [change.An](http://change.an) organization should be at least as dynamic as its environment. Changes to the organization should be expected and welcomed, so long as the changes are made in service of customers and communities.
3. Surrender the past.Honor what’s come before and help individuals grieve the losses that accompany change. Then, move forward together.
4. Chase fit, not fads.Success is an organization well-calibrated to its environment and out-delivering on its customers’ needs. Agile isn’t always the answer and six-sigma isn’t always the problem. Context is king.
5. Do no harm.Value small, “safe-to-fail” changes you can learn from quickly over a single, slow, sweeping, and risky change. From the small changes, spread and expand on what works. Learn from what doesn’t.
6. Design by doing.Organizations are complex adaptive systems, meaning you can’t understand how they behave or respond to change until you introduce changes. Diagramming in PowerPoint is not organizational design, it’s organizational fiction.

**7.** **Play your zone**. Focus others to first change the things in their control. Move on to the things they can influence. As you succeed together, you’ll expand both zones.

1. Advocate for the individual.Organizational change is merely individual behavior change on a mass scale. Individuals need the capability, motivation, and provocation to change. Train new skills. Design better rewards. Stage inspiring interventions.
2. Delay drawing boxes.Don’t start with org charts or titles. If you focus on purpose and strategies, structures will emerge organically.
3. Keep work simple.There are two kinds of organizational complexity: the complexity natural to delivering what customers need, and the added complexity of bureaucracies and personal egos. Kill the latter whenever it arises.
4. Make change a habit.Every team needs a recurring time and space to reflect on how to become more effective. Remember that when you document the implicit parts of teaming (norms, policies, roles, strategies, habits, procedures, and processes) you make them easier to reflect on and change.
